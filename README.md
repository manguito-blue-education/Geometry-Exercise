# Geometry Exercise

In this exercise you have to write code in the file `geometry.js` for calculating the area of a square, a triangle and a circle.

You should write the code inside the curly braces, where it says `Your amazing code here`.

For testing your code you must run: 

```sh
npm install

npm run test

```

Notes:

- You can read the test files, so you can have an idea of what is the expected result, but **do not edit them** please.

- In the case of the circle, the result **should be fixed** to 2 positions.
- All the results must be a *Number*.
